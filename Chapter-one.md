## Exercise 1: What is the function of the secondary memory in a computer?

Answer: 
c) Store information for the long term, even beyond a power cycle
 
## Exercise 2: What is a program?


Answer: A program is a set of instructions written by the programmer for a computer (CPU) to execute. A program is code meant to solve
a particular problem.

## Exercise 3: What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?

Answer: A compiler converts high level programming languages into machine code after the whole code has been written in a file.
The compiler converts the high level language into an executable machine code file.
An interpreter on the other hand parses high level programming language into machine code on the fly.

## Exercise 4: Which of the following contains “machine code”?

Answer: a) The Python interpreter


## Exercise 5: What is wrong with the following code:

`primt 'Hello world!'`
`File "<stdin>", line 1`

## Exercise 7: What will the following program print out:

`x = 43`
`x = x - 1`
`print(x)`

Answer: 42

## Exercise 8: Explain each of the following using an example of a human capability: (1) Central processing unit, (2) Main Memory, (3)
## Secondary Memory, (4) Input Device, and (5) Output Device. For example, “What is the human equivalent to a Central Processing Unit”?

Answer: 
1. The centtral processing unit is the brain (human equivalent) of the computer. it handles most of the calcuations and logic
performed by the computer. 

2. The Main Memory is the primary storage of the computer. It is where information that the CPU needs quickly is stored

3. The Secondary Memory is where information that should persist after computer power goes off is stored. it has more size 
than the main memory but it is slower.

4. Input device is used to feed the computer with data or information examples are the keyboard, the mouse, scanner etc

5. Output Device is used to bring out information from the computer. it includes monitors, speakers, printers etc


## Exercise 9: How do you fix a “Syntax Error”?

Answer: You fix Syntax errors by looking at the line where the error occurs and going back to write the correct 
syntax. Sometimes the error might have occured in the previous line.
